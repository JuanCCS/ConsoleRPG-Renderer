## Techincal Prototype for a Console Rendering Engine

#### The DrawGood rendering engine attempts to provide the functionality of a game engine, treating each character as a pixel. Some optimizations for the console:
1. The simulation only updates on state change or user input.
2. Solely the portions of the screen that change are re-drawn every update.
